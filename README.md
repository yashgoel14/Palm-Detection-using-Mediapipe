# Palm-Detection-using-Mediapipe
MediaPipe Hands utilizes an ML pipeline consisting of multiple models working together:  A palm detection model that operates on the full image and returns an oriented hand bounding box. A hand landmark model that operates on the cropped image region defined by the palm detector and returns high-fidelity 3D hand keypoints.
